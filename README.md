A collection of my data projects showcasing skills in data processing, visualization, and analysis. Explore how I turn data into actionable insights.


# [Project 1: Netflix Content Prediction](https://github.com/CraigJustin92/Netflix_Content_Prediction)

This project develops models to predict which movies are likely to be fast-added to Netflix within the first year of release.

## Objective
Enhance Netflix's content acquisition by identifying key predictors of fast-added movies.

## Approach
- **Analyze and clean data**
- **Engineer and select relevant features**
- **Test hypotheses with chi-squared**
- **Build and evaluate predictive models**
- **Identify actionable insights**

# [Project 2: Uber Fare Prediction Model](https://github.com/CraigJustin92/Uber-Fare-Prediction-Model)

## Objective
Develop a predictive model to estimate Uber fare amounts based on features such as distance traveled, number of passengers, and time of day.

## Approach
- **Validated coordinates, selected key features, and log-transformed fare amounts to address skewness.**
- **Calculated the distance between pickup and dropoff locations and added a season feature.**
- **Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize features, built and evaluated an OLS model, and assessed performance using metrics like R-squared, MSE, and MAE.**
- **Created scatter plots and histograms to analyze relationships and distribution.**
